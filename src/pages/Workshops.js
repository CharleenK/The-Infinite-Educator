        Building a community of learners in after school care The beginning of a
        new school sets the tone for the months ahead and plays a significant
        role in children’s academic and social/emotional success. The same can
        be said for children in after school care. After-school care programs
        play a vital role in supporting the social, emotional, and academic
        development of school age children. This workshop would support
        educators in building strong affective relationships with the children
        in their care. This workshop emphasizes the importance of building trust
        and engagement while creating a positive and inclusive after school care
        community. By implementing the strategies and techniques in this
        workshop, educators will have the tools to start the year off with a
        nurturing and inclusive environment that fosters positive relationships,
        active engagement, and a strong sense of belonging. This workshop aims
        to provide school age educators with strategies and techniques to foster
        meaningful relationships, support children’s development and create a
        community of learners in after school care. Strategies and Solutions for
        Children’s Challenging Behaviours Working with school age children in
        after school care can be both rewarding and challenging. One of the
        biggest issues that educators face is children’s challenging behaviour.
        This workshop aims to provide educators with tools and strategies that
        are both developmentally appropriate and effective in supporting
        children and their behaviours. This workshop will take educators through
        the reasons behind children’s behaviours. Learn effective strategies to
        prevent and manage challenging behaviours. And finally explore
        techniques for promoting positive behaviours and children’s social and
        emotional development. This workshop aims to equip educators with the
        knowledge and tools necessary to effectively address challenging
        behaviours and enhance the overall after school experience. Making a
        difference in the lives of school age children workshop This workshop
        will address the important role that school age educators have in the
        lives of young children. This workshop aims to empower educators with
        the knowledge and skills to build a positive environment, establish
        strong connections with children and believe in their ability to make a
        difference in the lives of children. This workshop will emphasize the
        importance of building a positive environment, which will include clear
        expectations, conflict resolution strategies and opportunities for child
        engagement. This workshop will also discuss the impact educators have on
        the lives of children, having a growth mindset and promoting resiliency
        in educators. This workshop will equip educators with the knowledge,
        strategies, and mindset necessary to feel empowered to make a difference
        in the lives of the children they work with everyday.
