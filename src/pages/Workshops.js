        Building a community of learners in after school care The beginning of a
        new school year sets the tone for the months ahead and plays a
        significant role in children’s academic and social/emotional success.
        The same can be said for children in after school care. After-school
        care programs play a vital role in supporting the social, emotional, and
        academic development of school age children. This workshop would support
        educators in building strong affective relationships with the children
        in their care. This workshop emphasizes the importance of building trust
        and engagement while creating a positive and inclusive after school care
        community. By implementing the strategies and techniques in this
        workshop, educators will have the tools to start the year off with a
        nurturing and inclusive environment that fosters positive relationships,
        active engagement, and a strong sense of belonging. This workshop aims
        to provide school age educators with strategies and techniques to foster
        meaningful relationships, support children’s development and create a
        community of learners in after school care.{" "}

        Strategies and Solutions for Children’s Challenging Behaviours Working
        with school age children in after school care can be both rewarding and
        challenging. One of the biggest issues that educators face is children’s
        challenging behaviour. This workshop aims to provide educators with
        tools and strategies that are both developmentally appropriate and
        effective in supporting children and their behaviours. This workshop
        will take educators through the reasons behind children’s behaviours.
        Learn effective strategies to prevent and manage challenging behaviours.
        And finally explore techniques for promoting positive behaviours and
        children’s social and emotional development. This workshop aims to equip
        educators with the knowledge and tools necessary to effectively address
        challenging behaviours and enhance the overall after school experience.
        Making a difference in the lives of school age children workshop This
        workshop will address the important role that school age educators have
        in the lives of young children. This workshop aims to empower educators
        with the knowledge and skills to build a positive environment, establish
        strong connections with children and believe in their ability to make a
        difference in the lives of children. This workshop will emphasize the
        importance of building a positive environment, which will include clear
        expectations, conflict resolution strategies and opportunities for child
        engagement. This workshop will also discuss the impact educators have on
        the lives of children, having a growth mindset and promoting resiliency
        in educators. This workshop will equip educators with the knowledge,
        strategies, and mindset necessary to feel empowered to make a difference
        in the lives of the children they work with everyday.
